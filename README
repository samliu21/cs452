Building (linux.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca)
========================================

cp -a /u/cs452/public/iotest <dest>
cd <dest>
make

This should produce iotest.elf and iotest.img. You can inspect the .elf file
(e.g., using readelf) to understand the structure of your compiled code. The
.img file is a memory image of your program (generated from the .elf file),
which can be deployed to the RPi and run. See the course web page for
deployment instructions.
